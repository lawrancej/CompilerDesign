Compiler Design
===============
CompilerDesign will be [open educational resources](#what-are-open-educational-resources) for understanding the design of compilers.

## What are open educational resources?
Open educational resources are material, such as textbooks, videos, tests, quizzes and problem sets licensed freely (e.g., under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license).

### Examples:

- <http://www.khanacademy.org/>
- <http://www.saylor.org/>

## How can I contribute to this?
Read the [contribution instructions and guidelines](HACKING.md).

## What is the license?
This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

## Why does this exist?
We are developing CompilerDesign open educational resources for two reasons:

### Learn by teaching
> Tell me and I'll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I'll understand. --- Chinese proverb

Authoring open educational resources is how we will learn about compiler design.
We [learn by doing](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html) (i.e., discussion, practice and [teaching others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching)).
While passive teaching methods (i.e., lectures, reading, demonstrations) convey information, to understand is to implement (put the material into practice).

### Open Textbook Challenge
[Open educational resources matter.](http://whyopenedmatters.org/)

The Saylor Foundation is offering a [$20,000 bounty](http://www.saylor.org/otc/) for a compiler textbook that [meets their criteria](http://www.saylor.org/open-textbook-challenge-peer-review-criteria/) and [covers these topics](http://www.saylor.org/content/coursemapping/CourseMappingFormCS304.xls) (see CourseMappingFormCS304.xls).
That foundation has developed a [free compiler course](http://www.saylor.org/courses/cs304/), but a Creative Commons licensed textbook is not yet available.

## What problems does this solve?
[CC-BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) compiler design textbooks do not yet exist.
While existing compiler design textbooks are excellent resources, their licensing hinders teaching and learning.
Posting textbook problem sets to the web is grounds for DMCA takedown notices, and even lawsuits.
By making educational resources open (or free as in freedom), we can do better.

## What will this include?
In time this project will encompass [several components](http://www.saylor.org/contribute/materials/):

 - Textbook
 - Slides
 - Cheat sheets
 - Video lectures
 - [Assessments](http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Telling-Students-to-Study/131622/)
