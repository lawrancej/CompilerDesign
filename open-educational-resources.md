Open Educational Resource project
=================================

In this course, we will attempt to produce `open educational
resources <#what-are-open-educational-resources>`_:

1. `A textbook <#how-do-i-produce-a-textbook>`_
2. `Educational videos <#how-do-i-produce-educational-videos>`_ $25,000
   prize
3. `Assessments (tests) that
   teach <[http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Telling-Students-to-Study/131622/](http://chronicle.com/article/Stop-Telling-Students-to-Study/131622/)>`_

Umm...

-  `What's the point <#whats-the-point>`_?
-  But `I'm just a student <#but-im-just-a-student-i-cant-do-this>`_!
-  `How will I be graded <#how-will-i-be-graded-on-my-contributions>`_?

What are open educational resources?
------------------------------------

`Creative
Commons <[http://creativecommons.org/](http://creativecommons.org/)>`_
licensed material for teaching and learning.

Examples:

-  <`http://www.khanacademy.org/ <http://www.khanacademy.org/>`_\ >
-  <`http://www.saylor.org/ <http://www.saylor.org/>`_\ >

But I'm just a student! I can't do this!
----------------------------------------

Professors, including myself, easily forget what we did not know.
Professors also forget the misconceptions we once held.

`Misconceptions
matter <[http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/>`_](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/)).
Anything we produce must include misconceptions to debunk them.

The professor asks questions in class to collect misconceptions (and
take attendance).

How will I be graded on my contributions?
-----------------------------------------
You won't be. Instead, you will receive feedback. Of course, if you contribute nothing, you cannot pass or receive feedback.

Followup:

- [How can I evaluate my own work](#how-can-i-evaluate-my-own-work)?

How can I evaluate my own work?
-------------------------------
Do:
- Check spelling, grammar, punctuation.
- Use active voice. For example: the professor wrote this document.
- Use the appropriate tense.
- Work together
- Ask and answer questions

Avoid:
- Weasel words, filler phrases. Examples: "the process of", "considered to be"
- Spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors
- Passive voice. For example, this document was written by the professor.
- Plagiarism (misrepresenting someone else's work as your own). For example, copying from Wikipedia.
- Adding [generated files](#what-are-generated-files) into [version control](git.md)
- Second person. Say "you" only when absolutely necessary.

Follow:
- Strunk & White. Elements of Style.
- [These criteria](http://www.saylor.org/open-textbook-challenge-peer-review-criteria/).

What are generated files?
-------------------------
The output of a compiler (e.g., binary or executable files).

What's the point?
-----------------

The point is to learn by teaching. Not just yourself, but everyone else.

Oh, and by the way, people *want* open textbooks and open educational
resources:

-  `There's a $20,000 prize for an open
   textbook <[http://www.saylor.org/otc/](http://www.saylor.org/otc/)>`_
-  `There's a $25,000 prize for open educational
   videos <[http://whyopenedmatters.org/](http://whyopenedmatters.org/)>`_

How do I produce a textbook?
----------------------------
--------------------------------
We're using github to track our contributions. Nobody will do it all. Therefore:

We're using github to track our contributions. Nobody will do it all.
Therefore:

-  `Pick a piece to contribute from the compiler course mapping
   outline <[http://www.saylor.org/content/coursemapping/CourseMappingFormCS304.xls](http://www.saylor.org/content/coursemapping/CourseMappingFormCS304.xls)>`_
-  Write or record what you can, push to github.
-  Solicit feedback.

If you want to go above and beyond, try contributing for other courses
as well.

-  `Course mapping forms across various
   courses <[http://www.saylor.org/course-mapping-forms/](http://www.saylor.org/course-mapping-forms/)>`_

How can I produce educational videos?
-------------------------------------

The mechanics are simple:

-  When recording a screen, use `screencasting
   software <[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_screencasting_software>`_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_screencasting\_software)).
-  Otherwise, use a camera, and video editing software.

Making a good video is more challenging:

-  `You must watch this
   first <[http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/>`_](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/khan-academy-and-the-effectiveness-of-science-videos/)).
-  `Khan academy is nice, but there are better
   ways <[http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-how-students-learn/](http://fnoschese.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/you-khant-ignore-how-students-learn/)>`_
