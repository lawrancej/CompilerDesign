Compilers
---------

### What is a compiler?
A compiler translates from a source [language](#what-is-a-language) to a target language.

Examples:

- GCC, Clang, Visual C++ translate C into machine code
- LaTeX, Pandoc translate document markup into PDF, HTML, etc.

### What is a language?
A [set](background.md#what-is-a-set) of [strings](background.md#what-is-a-string).

Examples and counterexamples:

- "I love you dearly!" is in English.
- "Love I dearly you!" is not in English, despite the English words.
- "int main() { return 0; }" is in C.

### What is Chomsky's hierarchy?
The Chomsky hierarchy (occasionally referred to as Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy) is a containment hierarchy of classes of formal grammars.
The hierarchy consists of four levels. Type-0 grammars (unrestricted grammars), Type-1 grammas (context sensitive grammars),
Type-2 grammars (contect-free grammars), and Type-3 grammars (regular grammars).
### What is an interpreter?

### The C compiler is written in C. How can that be?

### What are the phases of a compiler?
List the phases here. Briefly describe what each phase does. Give examples.

### Who is [Grace Hopper](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2516)?

#### Military Career

#### Contributions to Computer Science
 - Developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.
 - Conceptualized machine-independent programming languages.
 - Popularized the term "debugging."
 
#### Honors
 - "Computer Sciences Man of the Year" award from the Data Processing Management Association in 1969
 
Regular languages
-----------------

### What is a regular language?
[Regular expressions](#what-is-a-regular-expression) define the regular languages.

### What is a regular expression?
Regular expressions consist of:

Primitives:

- $\emptySet$. The empty set. Reject everything.
- $\epsilon$. The empty string. Match the empty string.
- c. Character. Match a single character

Operations:

If a and b are regular expressions, then the following are regular expressions:

- ab. Catenation.  Match a followed by b.
- a|b. Alternation. Match a or b.
- a*. Kleene closure. Matches a zero or more times.

### What is a finite automaton?


### What is an nondeterministic finite automaton?

### What is a deterministic finite automaton?

### How to convert an NFA to a DFA?

### What is the derivative of a regular expression?

### What is a scanner (lexical analyzer)?

Context-free languages
