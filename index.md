Compilers
---------

### What is a compiler?
A compiler translates from a source [language](#what-is-a-language) to a target language.

Examples:

- GCC, Clang, Visual C++ translate C into machine code
- LaTeX, Pandoc translate document markup into PDF, HTML, etc.

- [Who developed the first compiler](#who-is-grace-hopper)?

### What is a language?
A [set](background.md#what-is-a-set) of [strings](background.md#what-is-a-string).

Examples and counterexamples:

- "I love you dearly!" is in English.
- "Love I dearly you!" is not in English, despite the English words.
- "int main() { return 0; }" is in C.

### What is Chomsky's hierarchy?

### What is an interpreter?
An interpreter is a type of compiler that simply executes the code directly without translating it to a lower level.

Examples:

- Debuggers
- Scripting languages

### The C compiler is written in C. How can that be?
With the exception of the first ever C compiler, it is very possible to write C compilers and then compile them using another compiler. This is mostly due to the fact there is no “The C Compiler”; there are a multitude of compilers. Additionally you could compile a compiler in the same language by bootstrapping. Which is a series of steps that slowly builds up the compiler.

### What are the phases of a compiler?
Compilers operate around these phases:

Front end (process source language):

- [Scanner (Lexical analyzer)](#what-is-a-scanner). Split source code (a [string](background.md#what-is-a-string)) into a token sequence.
- [Parser (Syntactic analyzer)](#what-is-a-parser). Check if token sequence conforms to language grammar and construct the [parse tree](#what-is-a-parse-tree) or [abstract syntax tree](#what-is-an-abstract-syntax-tree).
- [Type checker (Semantic analyzer)](#what-is-a-type-checker). Check if the program is [semantically valid](#what-is-semantics).

Middle end (an intermediate representation):
- [Translator](#what-is-a-translator). Convert an abstract syntax tree into an [intermediate representation](#what-are-intermediate-representations).
- [Optimizer](#what-is-optimization). Improves IR code by eliminating redundancy and [dead code](#what-is-dead-code).

Back end (generate target language):
- [Code generator](#what-is-code-generation). Produces machine code.

### How do interpreters work?
Interpreters consist of the exact [same phases of a compiler](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler), but execute programs instead of [generating machine code](#what-is-code-generation).

### Who is [Grace Hopper](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2516)?

#### Military Career

#### Contributions to Computer Science
 - Developed the first compiler for a computer programming language.
 - Conceptualized machine-independent programming languages.
 - Popularized the term "debugging."
 
#### Honors
 - "Computer Sciences Man of the Year" award from the Data Processing Management Association in 1969
 
Regular languages
-----------------

### What is a regular language?
[Regular expressions](#what-is-a-regular-expression) define the regular languages.

### What is a regular expression?
Regular expressions consist of:

Primitives:

- $\emptySet$. The empty set. Reject everything.
- $\epsilon$. The empty string. Match the empty string.
- c. Character. Match a single character

Operations:

If a and b are regular expressions, then the following are regular expressions:

- ab. Catenation.  Match a followed by b.
- a|b. Alternation. Match a or b.
- a*. Kleene closure. Matches a zero or more times.
