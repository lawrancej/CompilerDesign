###### Types

###### Types of Types

###### Primitive
A primitive is defined as the base units that data can be stored in.
If we look at the C language we see variable types of char, int and double.
Each one of those is a primitive type.
Though C also has structures that can combine primitive types into one variable type.
While the data inside the structure can be primitive, the structure itself is not.

struct Color
{
	int red;
	int green;
	int blue
};

Color in this example is not a primitve type, because it is not a base unit of the language.
Red, green and blue are primitves because they are integers and intergers are a base unit in C.

###### Reference
<!--
5.1.1.2 Reference
-->
A reference is a value that tells a program where specific data exists.
References are commonly refered to as pointers because they "point to" the data they reference.
This means that the pointer holds the address of where the data is stored in memory rather than the actual data.
When using references they can also point to the first element in an array.
An array in this case be traversed by incrementing the pointer by the size of the type being held by the array.

###### Null
<!--
5.1.1.3 Null
-->
Null is the computational equivalent to nothing.
It can be used in many ways and implemented differently in different programming languages.
Most commonly, Null will equal zero or a pointer to zero (memory location 0x0000).
