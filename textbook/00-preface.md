Preface

--- Chinese proverb

This book aims to teach the concepts of compiler design Socratically through questions and follow-up.
It keeps definitions and explanations brief, because these alone do not teach.
Instead, it focuses on showing examples, counterexamples, and identifying misconceptions.
Examples and counterexamples illustrate terms to improve retention.
Understanding material involves clearing misconceptions, which is why the book identifies them.
