Semantic Analysis
=================

### What is semantics?

Semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages.
It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically legal strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved.
In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation.
Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language.
