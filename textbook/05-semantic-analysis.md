Semantic Analysis
=================

### What is semantics?

Semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages.
It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically legal strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved.
In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically illegal strings, the result would be non-computation.
Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language.

### What is static semantics?

<!--
4.2.1.2 Static Checking
4.2.1.2.1 Done at Compile Time
-->

Static semantics are enforced at compile time.
Examples of this include undeclared variables and type mismatches.
These semantical errors can be detected by the parser, or in separate semantic analysis passes.

<!-- I will add more to this section - Mike D -->
The semantic analyzer will start by traversing the [abstract syntax tree](#what-is-an-abstract-syntax-tree) created by the parser.



### What is runtime semantics?

<!--
4.2.1.2.2 Dynamic Checking Done at Runtime
-->

Runtime semantics are enforced during the execution of the program.
Examples of this include division by zero and out-of-bound array indexing.
One disadvantage of runtime semantics is that the object code tends to be slower.
Conversely, an advantage of these semantics is that it allows for informative error messages, rather than error behavior.

### What is type-checking?
