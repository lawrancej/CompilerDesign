Optimization
============

### What is optimization?
Optimization is the penultimate [compiler phase](#what-are-the-phases-of-a-compiler).
Optimizers improve code performance, size, and efficiency toward an optimum.

#### Example optimizations:

- [Peephole optimization](#what-is-peephole-optimization)
- [Loop unrolling](#what-is-loop-unrolling)
- [Method inlining](#what-is-method-inlining)
- [Dead code](#what-is-dead-code) elimination

### What is the point of optimization?
Unoptimized programs do not fully exploit underlying hardware capabilities, since [high-level languages](#what-is-a-high-level-langauge) abstract away from machine code.
Therefore, optimization can make programs:

 - Faster.
 - More efficient.
 - Smaller.

### What is peephole optimization?
Peephole optimizers replace small subsequences of instructions with fewer or faster instructions.
The sequence of instructions that the optimization operates on is called the "peephole" or "window". 

#### Example
Depending on the target language, a peephole optimizer would replace the following code:

    j = i * 16;

with this faster code (left bit shift is faster than generic multiplication):

    j = i << 4;

### What is single static assignment (SSA)?

### What is loop unrolling?
Loop unrolling, or loop unwinding, removes or precalculates control operations.
The optimization improves speed by removing expensive branches, but comes at the cost of space complexity.

Loop unrolling includes these optimizations:

- Precalculating the end of loop condition
- Precalculating pointer increments
- Optimizing memory access
- Running independent iterations in parallel

#### Example

Original Code

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        if (i == 0)
            Console.WriteLine("I'm the beginning");
        else if (i % 2 == 0)
            Console.Writeline("I'm even");
        else
            Console.Writeline("I'm odd");
    }

Unrolled Loop

    // i = 0
    Console.Writeline("I'm the beginning");
    // i = 1
    Console.Writeline("I'm odd");
    // i = 2
    Console.Writeline("I'm even");
    // i = 3
    Console.Writeline("I'm odd");
    // i = 4
    Console.Writeline("I'm even");

### What is method inlining?
Compiler optimization that replaces a function call with the body of the caller(i'm not very sure what this part means). This optimization may improve time and space usage when ran, but might make the program bigger.

### What is dead code?
Dead code is any code whose result is never used, and therefore a waste of resources.

Examples:
- Definitions of uncalled functions
- Computations that do not affect output
- `if (false) { /* Dead code */ }`


### Complexity
<!--
7.1.2 Complexity
-->

#### Many Optimizations Are NP-Complete 
<!--
7.1.2.1 Many Optimizations Are NP-Complete
-->
In compiler design, many code optimization problems are NP-complete, or undecidable.
 NP-complete problems are decision problems that take a long and inefficient amount of time to find a solution, yet verifying the solution can be done quickly.
 NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time", referring to running time of an algorithm that can exhibit different behaviors or different runs.
 Undecidable problems are decision problems that a single algorithm is not sufficient to accurately lead to a correct answer.
 

#### Memory Major Limitation in Other
<!--
7.1.2.2 Memory Major Limitation in Other
-->
 Memory limitations exist for optimization, as optimization is a cpu-heavy and memory heavy process.
 In addition, even the programmer's time to wait for a compiler to complete also places restrictions on optimization.

### Effectiveness
<!--
7.1.3 Effectiveness

#### What is the Target Architecture?
<!--
7.1.3.1 What is the Target Architecture?
-->
Architectural patterns are patterns that represent general functions required by the system.
The target architecture is one of those patterns to show the programmers a base to what they want to achieve.
The programmer then programs around this architecture taking into account all of the details.
The programmer cannot always accommodate all of the details as they may conflict with the architecture though.

##### The Machine on which the Program Will Run
<!--
7.1.3.1.1 The Machine on which the Program Will Run
-->
When designing a program, the programmer will always have the target computer in mind.
The computer may have fewer capabilities than the one that the software is being programmed on 
It may run on your own machine, but not the one in which the program will run.

##### What are the Factors that affect Effectiveness?
<!--
7.1.3.1.2  What are the Factors that affect Effectiveness?
-->
The factors in which will decide if the program will run on the computer are: CPU Registers, Pipelining, Cache, and the Hardware Design.

###### What are CPU Registers?
<!--
7.1.3.1.2.1 What are CPU Registers?
-->
The first is the CPU Registers, or a small amount of storage given to the processor so that mechanisms other than main memory can be accessed more quickly.
This can help the effectiveness of computer programs as they can store values that are accessed frequently in registers to improve performace.

###### What is Pipelining?
<!--
7.1.3.1.2.2 What is Pipelining?
7.1.3.1.2.3 What is a Cache?
-->
A pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected so that the output of one element is the input of the next.
The idea of this is to get processes done more efficiently, like an assembly line.
Each element is in charge of doing one part and is often done in parallel with the others so that everything gets done much faster and more efficiently.

###### What is a Cache?
A cache is a method of processing where the computer stores data temporarily until future requests for the data can be served faster.
Caches are generally smaller due to cost efficiency and efficient use of data.
This leads to effectiveness because it allows for great efficiency.

###### What is Hardware Design?
<!--
7.1.3.1.2.4 What is Hardware Design?
-->
The hardware design is big for effectiveness because, if you don't know what the hardware is going to be, you cannot write for that hardware.
A good example is like writing in assembly; you cannot write for an intel processor architecture when the computer has an AMD processor.
It is good to know the hardware design as it leads to an effective program.
			
#### Host Architecture
<!--
7.1.3.2 Host Architecture
-->

##### The Machine Doing the Compilation
<!--
7.1.3.2.1 The Machine Doing the Compilation
-->

##### Factors
<!--
7.1.3.2.2 Factors
-->

###### CPU Speed
<!--
7.1.3.2.2.1 CPU Speed
-->
CPU speed can be a major factor in compilation times.
The speed at which a compiler can perform lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, optimization, etcetera, weighs heavily on the effeciciency of the CPU.

###### Pipelining
<!--
7.1.3.2.2.2 Pipelining
-->
 Pipelining is a method of optimizing loops via out-of-order execution (instructions are executed in order of data availability rather than code position) where reordering is done by a compiler rather than the processor.

###### RAM Capacity and Architecture
<!--
7.1.3.2.2.3 Memory Capacity and Architecture
-->
 Like the CPU, RAM speed can be a major factor in compilation times.
Many CPU-based operations rely on RAM to temporarily store information in regards to the operations being executed, thus the amount of data that can be stored, and the speed at which it can be read and written, can affect the speed at which these operations will complete.

####### Hard Disks
 Certain phases of compilation, such as the reading of source files and headers and writing of object files, are disk-intensive.
The read/write spead of the disk can directly effect the rate at which these operations can be executed.
 While disk read/write speeds do not have as large of an impact in compilation times as CPU and RAM performance, they still have an impact on the overall execution time.

##### Program Usage
<!--
7.1.3.2.3 Program Usage
-->

###### Release vs Debugging
<!--
7.1.3.2.4.1 Release Is Often Optimized for Performance
7.1.3.2.4.2 Debug Program Contain Debugging Symbols which Slow the Execution
-->
 In a debug build, the complete symbolic debug information is emitted for testing and debugging purposes.
Code optimization is not a priority in debug releases.
 Release builds do not emit the symbolic debugging info, reducing the size of the final executable file.
The speed of execution may vary between debug and release builds depending on the compiler.

###### Peephole Optimization
Peephole Optimization is a type of optimization that works on very small sets of instructions in generated code at a time.
It then refactors sets so that it can be replaced by faster, more efficient code segments.
<!--
7.2.1.2 Connects Adjacent Instructions to See If They Can Be Compressed
	This optimization method will group together instructions to see if they can be compressed.
	It will then look at how the memory is being handled and remove unnecessary lines of code.
7.2.1.1 Performed after Machine Code Has Been Generated
	This is normally performed after the machine code has been generated.
	It will optimize the execution of the instruction at the lowest level.
7.2.1.1.1 EXAMPLE
-->
Take the instruction set:
		a = b + c;
		d = a + e;
		
What is actually implemented in machine code is:
		MOV b, R0
		ADD c, R0
		MOV R0, a
		MOV a, R0
		ADD e, R0
		MOV R0,d
		
This machine can be optimised.

It can be condensed to:
		MOV b, R0
		ADD c, R0
		MOV R0, a
		ADD e, R0
		MOV R0, d
		
By taking the code at its base level and optimising it there, 	the code will run much faster and have to execute even less 	commands to achieve the same result.
